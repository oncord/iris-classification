# **ETL Pipeline for Iris classification**

## **Overview**

This project was inspired by another project done in my probability/statistics with R class in which we performed an EDA/IDA on R's built-in Iris dataset and determined which feature(s) of the Iris flower were significant in classifying the species of Iris flower.
In this project, I construct a very simple batch ETL data pipeline to load a ML classification model using Apache Airflow to orchestrate the downstream tasks of ETL.
The use of Apache Airflow in this context is quite overkill and is only intended to be a proof of concept of automating the ETL process, along with acting as a learning experience for DE/ML tools/principles.
